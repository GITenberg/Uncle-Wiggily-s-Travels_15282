description: You know when Uncle Wiggily Longears, the old rabbit gentleman, started
  out to look for his fortune, he had to travel many weary miles, and many adventures
  happened to him. Some of those adventures I have told you in the book just before
  this one, and now I am going to tell you about his travels when he hoped to find
  a lot of money, so he would be rich. One day, Uncle Wiggily came to a farm, and
  there he had quite an adventure with a little boy.
